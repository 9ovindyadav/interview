## HTML and CSS interview questions

1. > what is the difference between absolute and fixed position ?

**Answer**:     
- " absolute " positioning is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block, while " fixed " positioning is relative to the viewport.
- " absolute " positioning is not affected by scrolling, while " fixed " positioning remains fixed even when the page is scrolled.
- Both positioning types take the element out of the normal document flow and allow precise positioning using the " top ", " bottom ", " left ", and " right " properties.

2. > what is the purpose of z-index property ?

**Answer**: The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements on a web page. It determines which elements appear in front of or behind other elements when they overlap in the z-axis (the depth or stacking order or layering of elements on the page).
